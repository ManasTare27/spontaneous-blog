    <h1>Blog Website</h1>
  <h3>How to write a blog?</h3>
  <p><b>I have absolutely no idea!</b> Can i just Chatgpt how to write a blog or get a boilerplate? <b>Yes</b>. Will I do that? <b>No</b>. Why? Because it's much more fun figuring something out by yourself </p>
  <p>Instead I'll just describe my day today. Gave C-CAT exam which i went okayish and that about sums up my day. Boring? Yeah. But alas what can i do about that other than writing about it here even though no one might read this <b><i>FOR NOW</i></b>.</p>
  <p>Also googled how long a blog post should be.</p>
  <p><i>"The ideal blog post length varies, but a good target for most blog posts is between 1,500 and 2,000 words"</i></p>
  <p>These blogs not upto standard. <b>Noted</b>.</p>
