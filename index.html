    <h1>Blog Wesbite</h1>
  <h3>Why this looks like this</h3>
  <p>The whole point of me making this blog website is to write blogs and improve the overall design and not waste my time trying to find the perfect looking website and not write blogs.</p>
  <p>One of the main problems I've faced daily is procrastination and wasting my time on unnecessary details. So I thought why not make a website to write my daily ideas and thoughts. This website will be like a journey to get rid of the whole it needs to be perfect only then is it according to my standard.</p>
  <p>This simple and plain website will be improved daily with minor updates.</p>
  <p>Can I consider this as my first blog? Well I have no idea, the entirety of this will have grammatical mistakes and an overall weird layout but it is what it is.</p>
